        <h1 class="title-text">Detecting and Mitigating DDoS Attacks with Moving Target Defense approach based on automated flow classification in SDN networks.</h1>
    </header>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) coordinates synchronized attacks on systems on the Internet using a set of infected hosts (bots). Bots are programmed to attack a determined target
        by firing a lot of synchronized requests, causing slowness or unavailability of the service.
          Recently, this type of attack has grown in magnitude, diversity, and economic cost. Thus, this paper
        aims to present a DDoS detection and mitigation architecture on Software Defined Networking
        (SDN). It considers the Moving Target Defense (MTD) approach, redirecting malicious floods
        for expendable low-capacity servers to protect the main server while discouraging the attacker.
        The redirecting decision is based on a sensor, that employs Machine Learning (ML) algorithms
        for flow classification. When malicious flows are detected, the sensor notifies the SDN controller
        to include them in the malicious lists and to realize the redirection. The validation and evaluation of the
          proposed architecture are conducted by simulation. Results considering different
        classification models (probabilistic, linear model, neural networks, and trees) and attack types
        indicate that the proposed architecture is efficient in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks in
        approximately 3.00 seconds.
